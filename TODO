Constants:
  pi ::= 3.14 -- $pi is the number 3.14
  pi' ::= "3.14" --$pi' is the text value of "3.14"
  list_pi ::=  -- $list_pi is a list of number values
    [ 1
    , 4
    , 1
    , 5
    , 9
    ]
  list_pi' ::= -- $list_pi' is a list of text values
    [ "3"
    , "."
    , "1"
    , "4"
    ]
  magic_op ::= * -- $magic_op is the multiplication operator
  width ::= 420 -- $width is the number 420
  height ::= 69 -- $height is the number 69
  area ::= -- $area is 420*69 or 28980
    Expr:
      Left: $width
      Op : $magic_op
      Right : $height
  wrong_area ::= -- parse error because this has undefined variables
    Expr:
      Left: $some_other_width
      Op: $what_op
      Right: $literally_undefined
  what_op ::= ^ -- $wrong area is still a parse error cause

also make expample defined function that does something more complicated

text manipulation?
list manipulation?
pseudo currying?


clean up and make clearer
